# Below is a modified sample configuration file for pam_mount that has 
# been  successfully used to do encrypted auto mounts on a gentoo box
# using both the same password as login and a sperate key file 
# and openssl. This works for cryptoloop and dm-crypt.

# Users' local configuration file (if there is none, comment out this

# Note: you must include either options_allow or options_deny to use
# this directive. I recommend also including options_require.
#
# Individual users may define additional volumes to mount if allowed
# by pam_mount.conf (usually ~/.pam_mount.conf).  The volume keyword is
# the only valid keyword in these per-user configuration files.  If the
# luserconf parameter is set in pam_mount.conf, allowing user-defined
# volume, then users may mount and unmount any volume they own at any
# mount point they own.  On some filesystem configurations this may be
# a security flaw so user-defined volumes are not allowed by the example
# pam_mount.conf distributed with pam_mount.
#
# Format: luserconf <file>
# luserconf .pam_mount.conf

# These directives determine which options may be specified in a user config
# file (luserconf). You must include one of these directives if you have a
# luserconf directive. You may not include both directives.
#
# If you have an options_allow directive, then the options listed in that
# directive wil be allowed, and all others rejected. If you have an
# options_deny directive, then the options listed will be denied, and all others
# permitted.
#
# You may use the wildcard '*' to match all options.
#
options_allow	nosuid,nodev,loop,encryption
# options_deny	suid,dev
# options_allow	*
# options_deny	*
#
# I recommend not permitting the suid and dev options.

# The options listed in this directive are required for all volumes from a
# user config file. That is, any volume specified in a user config file that
# does not include these options will be ignored.
#
# Note: you must make sure that a required option is permitted (either by
# including it in options_allow, or by not including it in options_deny).
#
# I recommend requiring at least nosuid and nodev.
#
# This is ignored completely if the volume is configured to get its options
# and mount point from /etc/fstab.
#
options_require	nosuid,nodev

# BEGIN GENTOO EXAMPLES FOR ENCRYPTED HOME
# user1 has an encrypted home that uses his/her system passwd as the 
# encryption key
# To create a USB dongle secured user see user2:
# Define a user key and group key to use a USB dongle as an encrypted
# file system for the key to the user2 file system - so user would need
# the USB dongle, the password for user key and the password for user
# user2. in order to access the encrypted home of user2. Note that 
# without the first two the user can still log in and create files
# on his home directory mount point. However the security for the
# encrypted volume is much better since a dictionary attack would need 
# the dongle. See http://www.counterpane.com/twofish-final.html
# for a discussion on why twofish is a good choice. This setup works
# with mm-sources-2.6.0_beta9-r5. So to login graphically as user2
# insert key, ctrl-alt-f1 login as key, alt-f7, login as user2, 
# ctrl-alt-f1, logout key, remove dongle. This works for KDM. Modify
# /etc/pam.d/login and /etc/pam.d/kde per docs
#volume key local - /dev/sda2 /key loop,encryption=twofish - -
#volume user1 local - /home/.user1 /home/user1 loop,encryption=twofish - -
#volume user2 local - /home/.user2 - - bf-ecb /key/sp.key
# /etc/fstab contains
#/home/.user2  /home/user2  reiserfs    user,loop,encryption=twofish,noauto     0 0
#/dev/sda2     /key         ext2        user,loop,encryption=twofish,noauto     0 0
#
# Device-Mapper based encryption (dm-crypt)
# Since the introduction of dm-crypt in Linux 2.6.4, cryptoloop has been
# deprecated. To use the new dm-crypt interface, you will have to adapt
# the preceding examples to use "crypt" instead of "local" as filesystem
# type. Additionally the cipher algorithm is specified via the "cipher"
# option (to distinguish from cryptoloop's "encryption"). Thus, the
# user1 example would look like this:
#volume user1 crypt - /home/.user1 /home/user1 loop,cipher=twofish - -
# An entry in /etc/fstab is not needed. A detailed HOWTO can be found in
# the forums: http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=274651
# END GENTOO EXAMPLES

#
# OpenBSD encrypted home directory example (see also lclmount above):
# volume user local - /home/user.img /home/user svnd0 - -
#
# The last two examples need a line like the following in 
# /etc/fstab:
#
# /home/user4.img /home/user4 xfs user,loop,encryption=aes,keybits=256,noauto 0 0
#
# Details:
# Local user configuration can extend this.
# Mount point must be owned by the user.
#
# If there are no servers, mount options, fs key ciphers, etc. you must 
# supply a "-"
#
# If a local mount is specified in a user config file, then the user must
# own the device or file being mounted.
#
# See http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Loopback-Encrypted-Filesystem-HOWTO.html
# to learn how to create a encrypted loopback filesystem.
#
# If the volume's password is different than the user's login password,
# the following technique may be used (see also README):
#
# 1.  Create a file containing the volume's password (FS key).  If you are
#     using pam_mount to mount an loopback encrypted volume, this password
#     should may generated by /dev/urandom.  
#
#     Simple example: 
#     echo <volume password> | openssl aes-256-ecb > /home/user.key
#     Encrypt this file using the user's login password as the key.
#
#     Verbose loopback encrypted volume example:
#     a.  dd if=/dev/urandom of=/home/user.img bs=1M count=<image size in MB>
#     b.  dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1c count=<keysize / 8> | openssl enc \
#         -<fs key cipher> > /home/user.key
#         Encrypt this file using the user's login password as the key.
#     c.  openssl enc -d -<fs key cipher> -in /home/user.key | losetup -e aes \
#         -k <keysize> -p0 /dev/loop0 /home/user.img
#     d.  mkfs -t ext2 /dev/loop0
#     e.  umount /dev/loop0
#     f.  losetup -d /dev/loop0
#
# 3.  In pam_mount.conf:
#	a.  Set the fs key cipher variable to the cipher used (ie: aes-256-ecb).
#	b.  Set the fs key path variable to the key's path (ie: /home/user.key)
# 4.  If a user changes his login password, regenerate the efsk that 
#     was created in step 1b.  A script named passwdehd is provided to do this.
#
# If fs_key_cipher is -, then the user's login password is also the volume's 
# password.

# Template (or wildcard) volumes
#
# If user is "*", "&" will be replaced by name of the user logging on in the
# volume, mount point, mount options and fs key path fields.  "~/*" will be
# replaced with "<user's homedir>/*."  In this mode, the user need not
# own the mount point, but it must exist.
#
# volume * smb krueger &     /home/&         uid=&,gid=&,dmask=0750 - -
# volume * smb krueger homes /home/&/remote  - - -
# volume * local - /home/&.img - - aes-256-ecb /etc/ehd/&

# Windows 2000, which requires a domain specified, example (thanks John Knox):
# volume * smb viper & /home/& uid=&,gid=&,dmask=0750,workgroup=WINDOWS_DOMAIN - -
